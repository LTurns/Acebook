## Project Description

Acebook is a social media platform, similar to Facebook, built as part of the Makers Academy course and specifically as part of the week 8-9 engineering project.

## Features

* User log in
* A Timeline of posts
* A user can create a post
* A user can edit and delete their own posts

## Dependencies

This project uses the following technologies:

## Getting Started

To get started using Acebook by Team Node4Code, please follow the instructions below:

### Install Node.js

**Skip this step if you already have Node.js installed**

1. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)
    ```
    brew install nvm
    ```
    Then follow the instructions to update your `~/.bash_profile`.
2. Open a new terminal
3. Install the latest long term support (LTS) version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), currently `12.14.1`.
    ```
    nvm install 12.14.1
    ```

### Getting set up

Once you have installed Node:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install Node.js dependencies using the command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Install MongoDB
    ```
    brew tap mongodb/brew
    brew install mongodb-community@4.2
    ```
4. Start MongoDB
    ```
    brew services start mongodb-community@4.2
    ```

### Using Acebook!

To use Acebook you must start the backend server, then start the frontend server.

1. To start the backend server, navigate to the Node4Code root directory and enter the command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

2. To start the front server, navigate to the directory named 'react' and enter the same command.

3. Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view and use Acebook!

## Testing

### To run tests

* Run all tests
    ```
    npm test
    ```
* Run a specific check
    ```
    npm run lint              # linter only
    npm run test:unit           # unit tests only
    npm run test:integration  # integration tests only
    ```

#### Starting the test server

The server must be running locally with test configuration for the
integration tests to pass.
```
npm run start:test
```
This starts the server on port `3030` and uses the `acebook_test` MongoDB database,
so that integration tests do not interact with the development server.
